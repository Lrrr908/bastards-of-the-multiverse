- **ICC-Compliant Color Matching**: Uses Lab(D50) color space for accurate ΔE calculations
- **Professional Workflow**: Supports chromatic adaptation and rendering intents
- **Real Physical Color Data**: Based on spectrophotometer scans, not approximations

## Technologies

- Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- No external dependencies required
- Works entirely in the browser

## Color Libraries

The system includes color data from:
